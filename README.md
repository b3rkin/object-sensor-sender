# The Project:
This project is written in the Arduino language for the Arduino Nano RP2040 Connect. The purpose of this project is to create a wifi access point on the arduino wifi chip and send accelerometer and gyroscope values using UDP packets to the device that connects to this access point.

## Current status of the project:
The device creates a WIFI access point called "tracked-object-AP" and then starts waiting for a connection. Once a device is connected to the AP, the Arduino expects an initial UDP packet to starts its operation. Currently the packet consists of 28 bytes of dummy data and is send over UDP 1000 times.

## I/O


## Units
The units used are compliant with the larger project this virtual IMU is part of.
